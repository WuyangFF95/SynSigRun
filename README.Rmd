Run Mutational Signature Analysis Software Packages Using Mutational Spectra generated by [SynSigGen](https://github.com/steverozen/SynSigGen) package.

## Purpose

An easy-to-use package for non-experts which runs software
packages reproducibly with synthetic tumors generated by [SynSigGen](https://github.com/steverozen/SynSigGen).
SynSigRun gives necessary information to mutational-signature analysis programs. These programs used catalogs of synthetic mutational spectra created by package [SynSigGen](https://github.com/steverozen/SynSigGen), and results were assessed by [SynSigEval](https://github.com/WuyangFF95/SynSigEval).

## Installation

Install the development version of SynSigRun from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with the R command line:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WuyangFF95/SynSigRun")
```
