## SynSigRun 1.0.0
### Cleaned in folder "data-raw/"

* Cleaned duplicate files already in package [SynSigGen](https://github.com/steverozen/SynSigGen)
* Sorted running scripts into folders named with authors of manuscripts.


## SynSigRun 0.1.2
### Added

* Added `4.join.combined.extraction.results.Wlicoxon.R` in folder `data-raw/scripts.for.SBS1SBS5`. This script is for combining csv files
which summarizes extraction measures. In order to obtain such csv files,
users should run scripts in `data-raw/scripts.for.SBS1SBS5/3a_evaluation_without_knowing_K`
and `data-raw/scripts.for.SBS1SBS5/3b_evaluation_given_K`.
* Fixed bugs in `RunmutSignatures()` `Runmaftools()` `RunMutationalPatterns`

## SynSigRun 0.1.1
### Fixed

In `RunSomaticSignatures()`:
* Fixed the unused parameter `CPU.cores` 
* Fixed the bug which spawns too many processes and exceeds `ulimit` in Linux.
* Fixed error in calculation of second derivative of RSS.


## SynSigRun 0.0.5
### Added

Added scripts at `data-raw/scripts.for.SBS1SBS5` for running computational approaches with synthetic tumor datasets generated by `SynSigGen::CreateSBS1SBS5CorrelatedSyntheticData` (requires `SynSigGen` version [1.0.4](https://github.com/steverozen/SynSigGen/tree/1.0.4)).

* `1_data_generation` - Generates 20 SBS1-SBS5 datasets at `data-raw/` or other repositories.
* `2_running_approaches` - running computational approaches using `SynSigRun` wrapper functions, and output results as a 5-level folder structure:
  * `2a_running_approaches_without_knowing_K` - runnning with number of ground-truth signatures (`K`) unspecfied
  * `2b_running_approaches_given_K` - running with K specified as 2
* `3_evaluation` - evaluating performance of signature extraction by calling evaluation functions in `SynSigEval`.
  * `3a_evaluation_without_knowing_K`
  * `3b_evaluation_given_K`

## SynSigRun 0.0.1.90xx
### Added
* Created [README.md](https://github.com/WuyangFF95/SynSigRun/blob/master/README.md) and reference manual.
* Added `biocViews` and `Remotes` as field name in the [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/WuyangFF95/SynSigRun/blob/master/DESCRIPTION).
