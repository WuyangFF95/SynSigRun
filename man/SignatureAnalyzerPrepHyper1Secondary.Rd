\usage{
SignatureAnalyzerPrepHyper1Secondary(
  non.hyper.results,
  primary.catalog,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{non.hyper.results}{The directory containing the the results of the analysis
of the non-hyper-mutated (a.k.a "PRIMARY") mutational spectra.}

\item{primary.catalog}{The catalog of non-hyper-mutated
mutational spectra from which the results in \code{non.hyper.results}
were derived.}

\item{hyper.catalog}{The catalog of hyper-mutated
mutational spectra which will be part of the input for the
secondary analysis.}

\item{secondary.catalog}{The final output catalog on which
the secondary analysis will be performed; this is a
\code{cbind} of pseudo-spectra generated from the PRIMARY
signatures with the \code{hyper.catalog}.}

\item{overwrite}{If \code{TRUE} overwrite possible previously
computed files and/or directories.}
